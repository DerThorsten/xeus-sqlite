API
===

This API refers to the magics implemented to execute operations that are not SQLite code. There's a distinction between `xvega` magics that implements magics from the `xvega` library and allows the user to create graphic visualizations of the `xeus-sqlite` outputs and the `xeus-sqlite` magics that allows file operations like create, load or delete a new database, and much more!
